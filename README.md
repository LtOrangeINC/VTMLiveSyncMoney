# VTMLiveSyncMoney
This small python script syncs your profile money from http://virtualtruckingmanager.com/ to your ingame money

Tested on Windows10 21H1 and using 
Python 3.7.3 (64bit)

The script only works if the game is ran on 32bit mode, the pointer has been found for that mode, it doesnt work on 64bit + ReadWriteMemory has problems reading and writing 64 bit addresses

I also inclued a cheat table that has the money pointer

Use:
pip install -r requirements.txt 

to install all the required modules
